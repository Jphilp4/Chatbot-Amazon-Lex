# 🤖 Building BankerBot: A Banking Chatbot with Amazon Lex

## Project Overview
I've started building a banking chatbot, **BankerBot**, using Amazon Lex. This project explores the essentials of chatbot design on AWS, leveraging Amazon Lex’s flexibility to create an interactive, engaging experience. Here’s a breakdown of what I achieved so far and what’s next for BankerBot.

### Project Highlights

### What I Did:
- **🤖 Set up the BankerBot chatbot from scratch:** Amazon Lex offers lots of customization options, including the ability to choose a voice for the chatbot to make interactions more lifelike.
- **💬 Designed a user-friendly greeting system:** BankerBot welcomes users with greetings like “Hi” and “Can you help me?”, creating a helpful, approachable first impression.
- **🤚 Configured a fallback mechanism:** The bot now offers helpful prompts when it doesn’t understand a user’s input, ensuring smooth communication and guiding users back on track.

### Next Phase:
- **🌟 Custom Slot Creation:** I’m excited to dive deeper into custom slots, enabling BankerBot to handle various bank account types and make user interactions even more intuitive and personalized. This will enhance the bot’s intelligence, providing users with relevant and accurate responses based on specific banking queries. 🚀👀

### Why Amazon Lex?
Amazon Lex provides powerful tools for natural language understanding, making it ideal for developing chatbots that need to interpret complex inputs accurately. The platform is particularly strong in offering customizable fallback and greeting options, which has been invaluable in creating BankerBot’s core features.
